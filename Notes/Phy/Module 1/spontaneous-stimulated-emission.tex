\ssubsection{Spontaneous emission}
Atom initially at excited state makes transition voluntarily on its own, without aid of any external agency, to ground state, and emits photon of energy $$h \nu_{12}=E_2-E_1$$
Different atoms of medium emits light at different times and different directions. Hence emitted photons are incoherent. The rate of emission is independent of incident energy (as no energy is supplied to the system.)

\ssubsection{Stimulated emission}
Here photon having energy $h\nu_{12}(=E_2-E_1)$ impinges on (or passes in the vicinity of) an atom present in its excited state and atom is stimulated to make transition to ground state and gives off a photon of energy $h \nu_{12}$. Emitted photon in is in phase with the incident photon. These two travel in same direction and posses same frequency. They're coherent.
