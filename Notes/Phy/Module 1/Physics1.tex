\usection{Laser}
LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Differing from conventional sources, lasers produce highly
directional, monochromatic, coherent and stimulated radiation. Lasing been extended from microwave(Maser) to $\gamma$-rays (Graser)

\usubsection {Characteristics}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Monuchromaticity}: The line width of laser beams are extremely narrow. (1 in $10^{15}$, in conventional light source, it is 1 in $10^6$). Degree of non-monochromaticly: $\xi=\Delta\lambda/\lambda$ = $\Delta\nu/\nu$($\Delta\lambda or \Delta\nu$  variation in wavelength or frequency of light)
	\item \textbf{Directionality}: Laser can travel very long distances without divergence.
	      \eqnleft{\text{Divergence: } \Delta \theta=\frac{r_2-r_1}{D_2-D_1}\text{ or }\frac{D^2}{\lambda}\text{ (Reliegh's range)}}
	      For laser: 0.01 milliradian\\
	      for search light 0.5 radian
	      $>\Rightarrow$ divergence
	\item \textbf{Coherence}\\
	      \textbf{Spatial coherence}: If a wave maintains a constant phase difference or in phase at two different points on
	      the wave over a time $t$, then the wave is said to have spatial coherence.

	      \textbf{Temporal coherence}: If there is no change in phase over a time $t$ at a point on the wave, then it is said to be coherent temporally
	      during that time. (these reference points are taken on electric field)
	\item \textbf{Brightness/intensity}\\
	      Laser produce highly intense beams, because more light energy is concentrated in a small region. Also laser light is coherent, so at a time many photons are in phase. They superimpose to produce a wave of larger amplitude. Hence resultant intensity ($\propto$amplitude$^2$) is very high.

\usubsection{Spontaneous \& stimulated emission}

\bigskip

\input{../images/sp-st-transition}

\ussubsection{Spontaneous emission}
Atom initially at excited state makes transition voluntarily on its own, without aid of any external agency, to ground state, and emits photon of energy $$h \nu_{12}=E_2-E_1$$
Different atoms of medium emits light at different times and different directions. Hence emitted photons are incoherent. The rate of emission is independent of incident energy (as no energy is supplied to the system.)

\ussubsection{Stimulated emission}
Here photon having energy $h\nu_{12}(=E_2-E_1)$ impinges on (or passes in the vicinity of) an atom present in its excited state and atom is stimulated to make transition to ground state and gives off a photon of energy $h \nu_{12}$. Emitted photon in is in phase with the incident photon. These two travel in same direction and posses same frequency. They're coherent.

\note{
	$\star$ At thermal equilibrium, all energy transitions are equally probable

\term{Finding $\rvv$}
\bigskip

Inside the container, radiation is present so, the number of photons per unit volume having frequencies around $\nu$ in unit range (i.e., radiation density) ,represented as $\rvv$ is given by Planck's black body radiation law as:
$$
	\rvv=\frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3\left[\exp \left(\dfrac{h \nu}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)-1\right]}
$$

In steady state:
\begin{flalign*}
	R_{ab}                                 & = R_{12} + R_{21}           &  & \\
	B_{12} n_1 \rvv                        & =A_{21} n_2+B_{21} n_2 \rvv &  & \\
	\text{(or)}                            &                             &  & \\
	\rvv\left[B_{12} n_1-B_{21} n_2\right] & =A_{21} n_2                 &  &
\end{flalign*}

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		\rvv=\cfrac{A_{21} n_2}{B_{12} n_1-B_{21} n_2} & =\cfrac{A_{21} n_2}{n_2 B_{21}\left[\cfrac{B_{12} n_1}{B_{21} n_2}-1\right]} \\
		                                               & =\cfrac{A_{21} / B_{21}}{\cfrac{B_{12} n_1}{B_{21} n_2} - 1}
	\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting Equation (6.1) in (6.8) for $n_1 / n_2$, we have:
$$
	\rvv=\cfrac{A_{21} / B_{21}}{\dfrac{B_{12}}{B_{21}} \exp \left(\dfrac{h \nu}{K_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)-1}
$$

In thermal equilibrium state, Equations (6.2) and (6.9) are equal.
so,
$$
	\cfrac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3\left[\exp \left(\cfrac{h \nu}{K_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)-1\right]}=\cfrac{A_{21} / B_{21}}{\cfrac{B_{12}}{B_{21}} \exp \left(\cfrac{h \nu}{K_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)-1}
$$

Under stimulated emission, the probability of upward transitions and probability of downward transitions are equal, so:
$$
	B_{12}=B_{21}=B \text { and } A_{21}=A \text { (say). }
$$

Then, Equation (6.10) becomes:
$$
	\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}}=\frac{A}{B}=\frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3}
$$

The proportionality constants $A_{21}, B_{12}$ and $B_{21}$ are called Einstein's $A$ and $B$ coefficients. From Equations (6.5) and (6.6), the ratio of spontaneous emission rate to stimulated emission rate is:
$$
	\frac{A_{21} n_2}{B_{21} n_2 \rvv}=\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21} \rvv}
$$

Substituting Equations (6.2) and (6.11) in (6.12) gives:
$$
	=\left. \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \middle/ \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3\left[\exp \left(\frac{h \nu}{K_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)-1\right]}\right. =\exp \left(\cfrac{h \nu}{K_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)-1
$$

This ratio works out to be $10^{10}$, thus at optical frequencies, the emission is predominantly spontaneous. So, the conventional light sources emit incoherent radiation.
6.5 Population inversion

Usually in a system the number of atoms $\left(N_1\right)$ present in the ground state $\left(E_1\right)$ is larger than the number of atoms $\left(N_2\right)$ present in the higher energy state. The process of making $N_2>N_1$ is called population inversion. Population inversion can be explained with three energy levels $E_1, E_2$ and $E_3$ of a system. Let $E_1, E_2$ and $E_3$ be ground state, metastable state and excited states of energies of the system respectively such that $E_1<E_2<E_3$. In a system, the population of atoms $(N)$ in an energy level $E$, at absolute temperature $T$ has been expressed in terms of the population $\left(N_1\right)$ in the ground state using Boltzmann's distribution law
$$
	N=N_1 \exp \left(-E / K_R T\right) \quad \text { where } K_B=\text { Boltzmann's constant }
$$

Graphically this has been shown in Fig. 6.2(b). As shown in Fig. 6.2(a), let the atoms in the system be excited from $E_1$ state to $E_3$ state by supplying energy equal to $E_3-E_1(=h \nu)$ from an external source. The atoms in $E_3$ state are unstable, they make downward transition in a time approximately $10^{-8}$ seconds to $E_2$ state. In $E_2$ state, the atoms stay over a very long duration of the order of milliseconds. So, the population of $E_2$ state increases steadily. As atoms in $E_1$ state are continuously excited to $E_3$ so, the population in $E_1$ energy level goes on decreasing. A stage will reach at which the population in $E_2$ state exceeds as that present in $E_1$ state (i.e., $N_2>N_1$ ). This situation is known as population inversion. Graphically the population inversion has been shown in Fig. 6.2(c).
Conditions for population inversion are:
(a) The system should possess at least a pair of energy levels $\left(E_2>E_1\right)$, separated by an energy equal to the energy of a photon ( $b v$ ).
(b) There should be a continuous supply of energy to the system such that the atoms must be raised continuously to the excited state.

\usubsection{Population Inversion}
\term{Population inversion}: a state of system in which more members of system are in high energy level than in lower level.
\begin{itemize}
	\item When photon of Energy $\Delta E$ (equal to difference in energy level) enters atom\\
	      probability of absorption = probability of spontaneous emission
	\item At Room temperature: $\Delta E = E_2-E_1 \approxeq 0.025 \uunit{eV}$ (Corresponding to IR radiation of $6 \times 10^{12} \uunit{Hz}$)
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\term{pumping}: Supplying energy to excite atoms to upper levels.

\usubsection{Metastable state}

The atoms excited will undergo spontaneous emission and attain popalation inversion. These atoms reach a intermediate state between the transitioning states which has more life time than higher energy state. This state is known as \textbf{metastable state}. From here, atoms undergo stimulated emission and lasing action takes place. (In two level systems, lasing action doesn't takes place because of lack of metastable state)


\usubsection{Representing transitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Absorption: $A+h\nu \rightarrow A^{*}$
	\item Spontaneous Emission: $A^{*} \rightarrow A+h\nu$
	\item Stimulated Emission : $A^{*}+h\nu \rightarrow A+2 h\nu$
\end{itemize}
$\star$ Emitted photon is identical to incident one. (have same frea, phase, polarisation)

$\star$ Since excited states are highly unstable (atom will returns to ground state in less than 1ns) an intermedioute energy level (which has life time of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$s) is required to create stimulated emission. This is achieved by using certain dopants.


\usubsection{Purity of spectral line}

Finite purity or sharpress $=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}$

$\Delta \nu / \Delta\lambda=$ Spread of frequency.

Fading of amplitude is explained by setting $\Delta\nu$ in time $\tau_c$ by unity:
$$
	\begin{aligned}
		 & \tau_c \Delta \nu=1 \Rightarrow \Delta \lambda=\frac{\lambda^2}{\tau_c c} \\
		 & L=c \tau_c=\frac{\lambda^2}{\Delta \lambda}= \lambda Q
	\end{aligned}
$$

For Sodium line: $\Delta \lambda = 0.12\amstr$
For He-Ne laser $\Delta \lambda = 0.0005 0.12\amstr$

\ussubsection{Working}
Due to electric dischange in gas, energetic electron interacts with ground state helium atoms. The impact of $e^{-}$ results in exchange of some of its energy to the atom. As a result. Helium atoms gets excited to higher energy levels: $F_{1} \& F_{2}$. These two energy levals are close to $E_{4} \& E_{6}$ levels of Neon atoms and collision of second kind takes place between them, hence we goes to excited state. $E_{5}$ of $E_{3}$. $E_2$ level of we forms metastable state.

3 types of transition are possible :

\begin{itemize}
	\item $E_{4} \rightarrow E_{3}$, emitting infrared light of $\lambda=1.15 \mu \mathrm{m}$
	\item $E_6$ $\rightarrow E_5$, emitting $F R$ of $\lambda = 3.39 \mu \mathrm{m}$
	\item $E_6 \rightarrow E_3$, emitting red light of $\lambda = 632.8$ nm
\end{itemize}

IR light emitted is absorped by the mirrors. Neon atoms in terminal level $E_{3}$ decay very rapialy to $E_{2}$ metastable state, much faster than spontaneously decaying from $E_{6} \rightarrow E_{3}$ level. Thus lower level $E_3$ is kept empty and population inversion is achieved between $E_{6} \& E_{3}$. Intensity of light produced is inversely proportional to diameter of quartz tube.

\input{../images/pulsed-graph.tex}

\ussubsection{Working}
Cr$^{3+}$ ions absorb pumping light and go to excited states E$_2$ \& E$_3$. From these a rapid non-radiation transition to the metastable level E$_m$ takes place. Decay from E$_m$ is very slow that with sufficient excitation, populations inversion between E$_m$ \& E$_1$ can occur. Those photons are allowed to pass many times in the active medium with the help of mirrors. When threshold conditions are. satisfied, an intense pulse of light of wavelength 6934$\amstr$ is emitted. Continuous operation is not possible due to excessive heating of active medium.
