\begin{itemize}
	\item Absorption: $A+h\nu \rightarrow A^{*}$
	\item Spontaneous Emission: $A^{*} \rightarrow A+h\nu$
	\item Stimulated Emission : $A^{*}+h\nu \rightarrow A+2 h\nu$
\end{itemize}
$\star$ Emitted photon is identical to incident one. (have same frea, phase, polarisation)

$\star$ Since excited states are highly unstable (atom will returns to ground state in less than 1ns) an intermedioute energy level (which has life time of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$s) is required to create stimulated emission. This is achieved by using certain dopants.
