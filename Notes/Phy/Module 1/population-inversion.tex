\subtopic{Population Inversion}
\term{Population inversion}: a state of system in which more members of system are in high energy level than in lower level.
\begin{itemize}
	\item When photon of Energy $\Delta E$ (equal to difference in energy level) enters atom\\
	      probability of absorption = probability of spontaneous emission
	\item At Room temperature: $\Delta E = E_2-E_1 \approxeq 0.025 \uunit{eV}$ (Corresponding to IR radiation of $6 \times 10^{12} \uunit{Hz}$)
\end{itemize}

At thermal equilibrium: $N\left(E_2\right) / N\left(E_1\right)=e ^ {-\left(E_2-E_1\right) / (kT)}$
