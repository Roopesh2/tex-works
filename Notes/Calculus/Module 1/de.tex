\topic{Differential equation (DE)}
An equation involving derivative(s) of dependent variable with respect to independent variable(s) is called differential equation.

\eqnleft{\text{e.g: } x \frac{dy}{dx}+y=0}


\begin{itemize}
	\item \term {Order of DE}: Order of highest order derivative of dependent variable, with respect to independent variable involved in the equation.
	\item \term {Degree of DE}: If differential equation is a polynomial equation of derivative, the highest power ( positive integral index) of highest order derivative is its degree.
\end{itemize}
